Will you rule the universe? Play and find out!


GAME OPTIONS:
You won’t need 2 desktops/laptops to play this game, one is enough!
If you don’t have an opponent it’s possible to add a droid into the game via the option menu.
You can choose how big the battlefield is and how many ships each player will have in their fleet.

PREPARE FOR BATTLE:
When you start positioning your spaceships you can only position them in a vertical or horizontal position, not diagonally.
It’s not possible to place a ship outside of the battlefield or on top of each other.
You won’t be able to change the position of your ship during the game.

BATTLE RULES:
Both battlefields are visible on the screen, but the fleets are hidden.
Each turn, players fire a laser to a certain coordinate in the universe by clicking on the opponent’s battlefield.
The purpose is to destroy all the enemy’s spaceships with as little as possible lasers.

It’s a hit! If there was a ship on the location that you fired, you will destroy that part of the spaceship and an explosion will be shown.
After destroying all parts of a ship, the destroyed ship will be visible on the battlefield.

It’s a miss! If you fire on a location not occupied by a spaceship on your opponent's battlefield, you will have fired in empty space.
The corresponding location will be greyed out and it won’t be possible to target that location anymore.
